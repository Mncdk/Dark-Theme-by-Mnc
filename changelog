0.8

  Changed version to 0.8 just to indicate that I'm closer to a version that I'm happy with.
  I'm writing this the day after finishing up 0.8, so there are a few things I'd like to tweak still.
  I'll get closer to a final version as I use the theme, and get a feel for everything.
  ...Still need to dial things in...
  I like the min,max,close buttons slightly red.
  I like the frame dark, but probably want it a little darker.
  May want the toolbar (and current tab) a little darker to match, but with a smaller change.
  Probably want inactive tabs less bright, but the active tab should still stand out a lot.
  
  I also need to figure out how much to write down. How many steps to document for posterity.
  Whether it's to explain to others what have changed, or remind myself if I want to change things
 at a later date.

0.2

  F#Â¤cked around with colors, making everything weird and ugly.
  Just so all the red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow things would stand out, so everything
 was easier to identify, and dial in the final colors.
