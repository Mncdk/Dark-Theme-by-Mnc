# Grey
Eh, I wanted something that I couldn't immediately find, a dark-ish theme that isn't super dark, and where different tabs can be told apart.
With stock Chrome 69 and the new tabs, I can't always tell which tab is active. I wanted to make a theme that changes that + gives me a tailormade dark theme.
