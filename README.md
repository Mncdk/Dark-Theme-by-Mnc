# Grey
This is just a Chrome theme. There isn't a lot of stuff to make a README for.
You should just be able to click the "add to chrome" button in the webstore or whatever.

I guess I'll add some note-to-self about what each field/setting affects.

"frame" :
 Top frame (space around tabs) on foreground windows with focus.

"frame_inactive" :
 Top frame (space around tabs) on windows without focus.

"background_tab" :
 Inactive tabs in the foreground window with focus.

"background_tab_inactive" :
 Inactive tabs in windows without focus.

"toolbar" :
 Toolbar covers the active tab background color, and the toolbar. All the area with buttons around the omnibox.

"tab_text" :
 Text on tabs. This seems to affect all tabs, active or not.

"tab_background_text" :
 Text on tabs in the foreground window without focus.
 I've previously set this to bright blue (0,0,255), and I couldn't find it until I made the tabs a little darker in 1.0.
 They then showed up as 244,244,255, suggesting to me that they were bluer than I intended.

"tab_text_inactive" :
 I've previously set this to bright red, and I couldn't find bright red anywhere. Suddenly, this showed up as "active tab, background window." where expected. Set it to the same value as tab_text above.

"tab_background_text_inactive" :
 I've previously set this to bright green, and I couldn't find bright green anywhere. Still never found it, but set it to the same value as tab_background_text above, for now.
 I think this ought to be inctive tab, background window.

"bookmark_text" :
 The text on bookmarks, and text on the download bar, etc.

"ntp_background" :
 New Tab Page background color. The other NTP color-options don't seem to do much in Chrome 69.

"button_background" :
 Min, max, close buttons. I like mine slightly red.
